# Celitra 

is an app that lets you step into the Web3 world, create and own AI-generated NFT based on a simple Text Prompt without the need of creating any EOA wallet or reading up on any Web3 jargon. Enter and make the Web3 ecosystem yours, just like Web2. 

## Structure

Celitra allows users to sign into the Web3 network without any Metamask/EOA wallet, create an NFT using Stable Diffusion AI and mint them to their wallets in a single click!

### Need for the product 

The major difference from Web2 that keeps people on the fence about joining Web3 is 
1. Lack of understanding of wallet creation and seedless phrases management
2. Jargon surrounding Minting, NFTs, Proof-of-Stake and a million terms that seem intimidating
3. Looks like something that's relevant only for traders, and not for people who just want to have fun 
4. Aversion to making payments or adding fiat money due to less understanding of how crypto payments work
